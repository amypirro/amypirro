# Hello 👋 I'm Amy!

I’m a methodical, problem-solving full-stack engineer who enjoys crafting cohesive products with user experience top of mind. I love looking back at the progression of a project, turning what was simply an idea into something tangible and useful, with persistence, collaboration, and an eagerness to learn and continually improve. I truly enjoy investigating code line-by-line to debug, and thrive on that triumphant moment of becoming unstuck.
