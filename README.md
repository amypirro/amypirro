# Hello 👋 I'm Amy!

I’m a methodical, problem-solving full-stack engineer with a background in graphic design and marketing, with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-centric applications. I enjoy transforming ideas into tangible, useful products through persistence, collaboration, and a continuous eagerness to learn and improve. I thrive on meticulously investigating code line-by-line to debug, savoring the triumphant moments of overcoming challenges and bringing projects to life.
